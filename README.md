# 🎮 Day 22 – Pong Game (Player vs Player Edition)

Welcome to **Day 22** of my **#100DaysOfCode** challenge!  
Today, I recreated the legendary **PONG** arcade game using Python and the `turtle` module — but with a fun twist!

## 🔥 Features
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Player vs Player** Mode (W/S & ↑/↓ keys)
- 🚀 **Ball Speed Increases** after every score
- 🎯 **Live Scoreboard**
- 🎨 Random ball color on every paddle hit
- 💡 Simple, clean game loop with real-time updates

## 🎮 Controls

| Player    | Up   | Down |
|-----------|------|------|
| Player A  | `W`  | `S`  |
| Player B  | `↑`  | `↓`  |

## 📚 What I Learned
- Real-time game logic and loop control
- Object-oriented programming in Python
- Collision detection (walls, paddles)
- Keyboard event handling with `turtle`

## 🛠 How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then clone the repo and run:

```bash
python pong_game.py
